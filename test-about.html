    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Collier Campbell. I'm a skilled UX designer and human factors engineer who specializes in creating user-friendly and visually aesthetic designs. 
      I have a background in human factors and UX design with over 5 years of experience tackling challenges facing users. 
      I strive to create experiences that are both intuitive and engaging. 
      My work is focused on collecting and understanding user needs and transforming them into effective, easy-to-understand design solutions.</p>
    <br>
  <p>In addition to my professional work in human factors and UX design, I am exploring computer programming and artificial intelligence as an outside challenge.
    In fact, this website represents my first real attempt at using HTML and CSS to create a functioning user interface via programming.
    Along with the help of AI, my website was created and iterated on over the course of many weeks of trial and error.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy the outdoors, staying active, and pursuing new hobbies.
    Those hobbies include but are not limited to cooking, fitness, woodworking, and reading.
